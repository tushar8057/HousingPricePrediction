# House Price Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to predict the price of a house by its features. If you are a buyer or seller of the house but you donâ€™t know the exact price of the house, so supervised machine learning regression algorithms can help you to predict the price of the house just providing features of the target house.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant attributes that influence house prices. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure the quality of the data.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tushar8057/HousePricePrediction.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the main script:

```
python house_price_prediction.py
```

## Usage

The main script `house_price_prediction.py` contains the code for training and evaluating the house price prediction model. You can modify the script according to your needs, such as changing the model architecture, adjusting hyperparameters, or exploring different algorithms.
